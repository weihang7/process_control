        <h1>Revisiting Process Control with New Processor Features</h1>
        <h3>Weihang Fan (wfan)</h3>
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            My collaborator will be Professor Todd Mowry, professor in the Computer Science Department.
        </p>
        <p>This project would involve first measuring the effects of some modern processor features, such as TurboBoost on various workloads. Specifically, we want to look at the behavior (in terms of performance) of programs when they are given less threads than cores available. Then, we would need to characterize the kind of workloads for which intentionally decreasing the number of threads below the number of cores would increase performance. To concretely implement a solution taking advantage of this characterization, we will implement a modification to the process control mechanism in OpenMP to dynamically adjust the number of threads based on measured program behavior (e.g. cache misses).
        </p>
        <p>
            The main challenge of this project lies in the fact that the hypothesis goes against decades of established knowledge in parallel computing - that in general it is best to run parallel programs with the number of threads equal to the number of virtual cores available. In addition, on the implementation side, OpenMP implementations are very low-level and the source codes are complex, figuring out how to modify them to perform process control could be very difficult and nearly impossible. In addition, measuring things like cache misses and processor frequency could be inaccessible to user-mode programs like OpenMP, and we might need to figure out some creative ways of implementing the dynamic measurement.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <h3>75%</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Measure the impact, in terms of performance and energy efficiency, of reducing the number of processes on non-false-sharing programs and programs that do have a lot of false sharing</li>
            <li>Characterize program behavior where reducing the number of threads would improve performance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>100%</h3>
        All of the above, and either of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Implement a modification to OpenMP that dynamically detects the number of cache misses and performs process control to improve performance</li>
            <li>Implement a modification to OpenMP that dynamically detects when TurboBoost would be more effective than multiprocessing and performs process control to improve performance</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>125%</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Both of the above</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Resources Needed</h2>
        <p>In order to perform performance will use the latedays cluster, which has nodes with two six-core Xeon e5-2620 v3 processors with all of the modern features that we would like to measure (TurboBoost, hyperthreading, cache hierarchy, etc.). If needed, we might want to utilize bare metal servers on vultr.io for more variety in hardware.
